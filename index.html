        <h2>My Goals for the next two years in the tech field</h2>
        <p>My name is Manfred Pepple. I am currently on HNG11 Internship boot camp in the Front-end track.</p>
        <p>This is my Stage 1 Project, and I believe that I will make more interesting projects during the period of the
        internship.</p>
        <h3>The Next Two Years in view</h3>
        <p>I would like to be a sought-after name in the next two years when it comes to delivering user-friendly apps and
        websites, due to my impeccable front-end development prowess and capability.</p>
        <p>I would like to be at the fore-front of front-end developers that are making technological contributions to the
        ecosystem; using new front-end technologies and solving real life problems by providing tailored solutions that are
        second to none.</p>
        <p>I would like to be in a community of tech gurus, that are also giving back to society by training tech enthusiasts and
        interns as well in website development, especially in front-end development.</p>
        <p>I hope to have built so many live projects and solutions that would be a reference point for others to see and get
        inspiration from.</p>
        <p>I am excited about this opportunity that HNG is providing for tech enthusiasts to take advantage of, by starting a
        career in tech or furthering it as the case may be.</p>
        <p>In anticipation of what is ahead and the great results that this opportunity would bring, I hereby say…”see you in the
        future!”</p>
